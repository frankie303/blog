<h4>hey! ðŸ‘‹</h4>

<p>I decided to share my learning experience with <a href='https://type-level-typescript.com/' target='_blank'>Type-Level TypeScript</a> course under this blog series. My plan is to create a blog post for each chapter. In this course, the first four chapters are free so if I manage to complete blogging them, maybe I can ask for permission from its creator to blog the rest of the series because I'm not sure whether it's ok to share some content from it publicly ðŸ˜¬. I always wanted to write some blogs but so far, this hasn't quite happened. So, we'll see how far I'll go this time.</p>

<p>Before finishing this post, I want to briefly share my thoughts about why I'm motivated and enthusiastic about learning Type Level TypeScript. I started using TypeScript about 2 years ago in my previous company and in my first team there, we had some strict rules like `do not use <a href='https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#any' target='_blank'>any</a>/<a href='https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-assertions' target='_blank'>as</a>/<a href='https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-6.html#suppress-errors-in-ts-files-using--ts-ignore-comments' target='_blank'>@ts-ignore</a> if it's possible`. Thanks to these constraints, we had a pretty type safe codebase and I experimented how this makes the developer experience better from various aspects. It prevents potential bugs, makes it easier to refactor and understand the code. Especially, for the new joiners, it speeds up the onboarding process because, if they hover over the variables, they can see the shape of the data easily thanks to TypeScript.
</p>

<p>But for me, the even more interesting part started when I first see some `advanced` TypeScript features like generics, utility types, conditional types, etc. When I checked some type definition files of the libraries I use every day, I was fascinated and I understood that all the smart type inferences are happening thanks to these well-written and complex types which were written by library authors. This makes me excited and I also want to be able to utilize the capability of TypeScript whenever it's needed. So, that's my goal and we'll see whether this is gonna be the case or not.</p>

<p>In my next post, I'll start with <a href='https://type-level-typescript.com/types-and-values' target='_blank'>Types & Values</a>. Let's go! ðŸš€</p>
